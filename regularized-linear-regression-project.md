### US county-level sociodemographic and health resource data (2018-2019)

Sociodemographic and health resource data have been collected by county in the
United States and we want to find out if there is any relationship between health
resources and sociodemographic data.

To do this, you need to set a target variable (health-related) to conduct the analysis.

#### Step 1: Loading the dataset

The dataset can be found in this project folder under the name ```demographic_health_data.csv```.
You can load it into the code directly from the
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/regularized-linear-regression-project-tutorial/main/demographic_health_data.csv)
or download it and add it by hand in your repository. In this dataset you will find
a large number of variables, which you will find defined [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/regularized-linear-regression-project-tutorial/main/data_dict.csv).

#### Step 2: Perform a full EDA

This second step is vital to ensure that we keep the variables that are strictly
necessary and eliminate those that are not relevant or do not provide information.
Use the example Notebook we worked on and adapt it to this use case.

Be sure to conveniently divide the data set into ```train``` and ```test``` as we
have seen in previous lessons.

#### Step 3: Build a regression model

Start solving the problem by implementing a linear regression model and analyze the
results.Then, using the same data and default attributes, build a Lasso model and
compare the results with the baseline linear regression.

Analyze how <code>R<sup>2</sup></code>
evolves when the hyperparameter of the Lasso model changes (you can for example
start testing from a value of 0.0 and work your way up to a value of 20). Draw
these values in a line diagram.

#### Step 4: Optimize the previous model

After training the Lasso model, if the results are not satisfactory, optimize it
using one of the techniques seen above.
